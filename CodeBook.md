This codebook refers to the tidy data set created using run_analysis.R on the UCI HAR Dataset.

Raw Data: Features data and the test and training data sets for measurements data, activity data, and subject data.

The features variables were transformed as follows:

tBodyAcc -> timebodyacceleration ttGravityAcc -> timegravityacceleration tBodyAccJerk -> timebodyaccelerationjerk tBodyGyro -> timebodygyro tBodyGyroJerk -> timebodygyrojerk tBodyAccMag -> timebodyaccelerationmagnitude tGravityAccMag -> timegravityaccelerationmagnitude tBodyAccJerkMag -> timebodyaccelerationjerkmagnitude tBodyGyroMag -> timebodygyromagnitude tBodyGyroJerkMag-> timebodygyrojerkmagnitude fBodyAcc -> frequencybodyacceleration fBodyAccJerk -> frequencybodyacceleration fBodyGyro -> frequencybodygyro fBodyAccMag -> frequencybodyaccelerationmagnitude fBodyAccJerkMag -> frequencybodyaccelerationjerkmagnitude fBodyGyroMag -> frequencybodygyromagnitude fBodyGyroJerkMag-> frequencygyrojerkmagnitude

Activity data was transformed into descriptive name:

1 WALKING 2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS 3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS 4 SITTING 5 STANDING 6 LAYING

Processed Data: The set of feature variables evaluated for mean and standard deviation observations were retained. The tidy data set(available as tidydat.txt) is average of these values for these measurements by subject identified by integers(1-30), and the activity identified as above. The measurements have been normalized so there are no units.
